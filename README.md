## Dedispersion, implemented in Julia.

</div>

<div align="justify">

This is a work-in-progress implementation of the dedispersion algorithm in
Julia. It is meant to serve as a proof-of-concept, that will gradually mature
into something that can be used in production. The hope is that this library can
achieve C/C++ like speeds, but with readable, understandable, and extendible
code. This package will be benchmarked for every release published on GitHub;
the benchmarks can be checked out [**here**](bench/README.md). For all releases
prior to the `v0.1.0` release, expect a high incidence of bugs and API changes.
It is hoped that package will be sufficiently tested before being released via
the Julia packaging system for wider consumption.
